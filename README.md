V3.1 releases soon  
## V3.1.pre3 update:  
added game logs as `gissa_talet_latest_log.txt`  
`stfu` command now gives a "y/n" prompt before overriding save file version  
backwards compatability with pre-v3 versions  
  
I will probably only test the game on Windows
  
Gissa talet is swedish for guess the number  
There are 3 ranked gamemodes: easy, medium, hard  
with greater ranges of possible answers  
  
I was going to explain how the game works but tbh I'm too lazy and I believe you are smart enough to figure it out yourself
